This is Net::RMI, a perl-specific package for Remote Method Invocation.


!!! EARLY ALPHA WARNING !!!

This package is hot-off-the-keyboard and has not be tested in any
significant fashion. Please contact me with all comments, suggestions,
and bug reports. This is EARLY ALPHA software.


See the INSTALL file for installation notes.

Currently I am using port 6902. This was just an arbitrary choice.
If anyone actually decides to use this module, we will have to get
a more "official" port number. The port number is set at:

	$Net::RMI::PORT

If anyone actually tries to use this, please drop me a line!

I will be putting more info up at www.pandich.com soon.
